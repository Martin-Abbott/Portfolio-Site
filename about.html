    <h1>About Me</h1>
    <p>Hi, I'm Martin. I'm a tech fanatic with a decade of experience in computer aided design, primarily designing products for safety-critical industries. In an attempt to fully unleash the power of high-end modern CAD packages, I began to experiment with automation scripts to eliminate time spent performing repetitive tasks, and from that, a passion for code was born!</p>
    <h2>Hobbies & Interests</h2>
    <p>When I'm not busy coding, you might find me:<p>
